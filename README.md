*All in the name of Liberty*

Tactical espionage action game by myself and [Guilherme Mar√ßon](https://github.com/gmarcon17). Made for Game Engine IS school class with the Unity engine.
It tells the story of an unjustly arrested man trying to reclaim his freedom.

To play it, just download it and build it inside Unity. We used version `2017.1.1f1`.
We used some assets available for free in the asset store.
